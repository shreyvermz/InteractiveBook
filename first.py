# CARRIAN KREAUX
    # main character of the book
    
    # child of murdered parents Arthur and Vivian
    
    # 23 years old, steadfast, promising future
    
    # should lead or be heavily involved in investigation process while keeping himself
    # away from primary suspicion
    
    # wants to use the death of his father to spur his family back to their ruthless 
    # way of life. Hopes that they will rediscover their bloodlust in search of the killer,
    # or they will forgive the killer and Carrian brings a new age to the family
     
    # he wont be suspected much besides his sister, who fails to catch him
    # either a lack of evidence, convincing the family that he was innocent and they live on
    # main suspecting character is killed off by him
        #either by Carrian or a family execution orchestrated by Carrian
        
# PENELOPE KREAUX
    # Carrian's 16 year old sister
    
    # handles the parents deaths differently than Carrian
    
    # her reaction is seen as more hysterical and more volatile than Carrians,
    # establishing more family trust with Carrian as he is responsible
    
    # dichotomy in reactions causes rest of the family to trust Carrian more
    # and further villainizing her
    
    # she could be the one to accuse Carrian of the murder and bring suspicions of him
    # to light in front of the whole family, but their perception of her along with
    # blaming the murder on someone who seems to be the reason they have any leads in
    # in the first place will lead to her demise
    
# ARTHUR KREAUX
    # father of Carrian and Penelope
    
    # kind, distrusting in the killing ways of the Kreauxs
    
    # wife, Vivian, died many years ago and he raised Carrian and Penelope by himself
    
    # Used to be the most revered hitman in the family and the orchestrator of their grand
    # plans. For this he was admired by Carrian, who began to idolize the ruthless version
    # of his father.
    
    # His change of ways could be seen as accepted on the exterior by Carrian
        # Carrian takes a while to come to terms in the shift of Arthur's perspective
        # adopts a guise of acceptance while beginning his journey to carry on the original
        # family ways
    
    # if Carrians family arrives at the conclusion of forgiving, it should be apparent
    # that the kindness of Arthur was the reason they gave up their ways
    
# MORGAN KREAUX
    # sister of Arthur
    # unremarkable, most average member of their family. Thats how it always has been
    
    # Didnt resent Arthur, but often felt overshadowed
    
    # Carrian may try to convince her to aid him in his plots
        # after much turmoi and almost joining him, redeems herself and is either
        # killed by Carrian or is the reason he is caght, if at all
        
# MARKO KREAUX
    # husband of Morgan
    
    # not explored too much as a character due to shortness of the story, but is shown
    # to be somewhat of a father figure to Carrian
    
# DORIAN
    # son of Morgan and Marko
    
    # can be the yin to Carrians yang
        # not sure if he should be a prodigy akin to Carrian or the bottom of the family\'s
        # barrel in terms of skill set.
        # He could have the most commendable character of the family, but the Kreauxs dont value
        # that the same
        
    # is the embodiment of kindness and respected Arthur after he changed his ways
    
    # finds purpose in urging the Kreauxs to discontinue their murderous ways
    
    # can be the main roadblock for Carrian, as they argue over continuing the
    # life them and their ancestors had known
